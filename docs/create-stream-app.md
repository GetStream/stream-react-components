# Creating a new Stream app + feed group

1. Head on over to [https://getstream.io/dashboard](https://getstream.io/dashboard), and create an account if necessary
2. Click the "Create App" button in the upper right, fill out and submit the form
   * Name doesn't matter
   * Select the server location closest to you
   * Production vs development doesn't matter, but you'll only be able to delete data with a "development" app
3. From within your app, click the "Add Feed Group" button in the middle, name your feed group "profile", and select a "Flat" feed
   * Your feed group name doesn't actually matter - "profile" is just convenient, but you can name it whatever you'd like
   * For now, only a flat feed is supported - notification and aggregated feeds will be supported soon!
   * Realtime can be on or off
4. At the bottom of the page, you'll see your Stream "Key" and "Secret" - you'll use those later
